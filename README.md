 you are a number
 
------------------
I will use Scaffold ETH 2, since that's what we learned with in Urbe Bootcamp at 42 Prague.
.
The idea is to create and authentication and privilege system for Evil Megacorp.
Permission to mint NFT auth key will be given to wallets stored in CAN MINT LIST (in AUTH Smart contract ?? // COSTS!
Only highest clearance 7 users can add addresses to CAN MINT LIST. Only on the condition the user is not already in CHAIN.
Once address minted an NFT it is deleted from the CAN MINT LIST and added to the CHAIN of users.. gets it's number in the row and clearance level.
Clearance 7 can add clearance 6 users. Top clearance (owner) can give any clearance.
Once key is minted, clearance level can be adjusted by owner.
